## Inspiration
As a college student, there are so many things to do. We have to do homework, housework, and etc... We also have to take care of the finance without help from guardian. In a busy schedule everyday, it would be great if someone could help us for free about finance issues. And we saw the challenge topic at TAMUHack. As time goes, there are kiosk instead of check in table in the restaurant. People started to use credit cards more than cash. So, we thought having a beneficial credit card as a college student will be good to save money.

## What it does
This website creates a credit card recommendation for college students. For example, the user will need to sign up to enter her/his personal info, and the website will return a list of credit cards that are most beneficial for the user. The progress of getting the user's personal info will be like a quick survey on the website. In addition, if the user scroll down, the website shows the generated graphs and charts that show the money the user saved over time using different credit cards. For a better experience, user can join a short survey through the power virtual agent. Basically, it shows the credit card information including the cash back rate per categories, sign up fee, and card company.

## How we built it
We first search up some credit card informations and create our small database, then we transform this database into simple react objects. We then applied formulas based on the spending habits and credit card benefit, at last generate the best result for the users.
Tech stack: React/Node, GitHub page

## Challenges we ran into
We could not find any database that includes all the information about credit cards from many different companies. So, we had to find a website that combined all the links to the credit card information, and create a dataset for our own.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We integrate various front-end package/libraries into a working project. We also learn how to deploy a race project on cloud.

## What we learned
As new hackers, we learned how to make a dataset. We learned how to work as a team with good communication and team cooperation. There are first time hackers in our team, we are glad that the could have a real-world experience of building software. 

## What's next for Credit Card Helper
For Credit Card Helper, we can expand the dataset as we collect more datas from different credit card company. That will make us able to create a next step which is to collect user's credit card name(title) and find out how much money the user could spend if the user applied to the matched credit card from the first step
